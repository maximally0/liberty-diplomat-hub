Nice — I got you. Below is a single **drop-in builder prompt** you can paste straight into any UI-builder (Framer AI, Builder.io, Replit, v0.dev, Uizard, etc.) to **generate the full registration UX** for ProjectLiberty — from microsite → signup → committee selection → portfolio upload → pay now / pay later flows → confirmation / reminders — including organizer-side views and all UI states. It's frontend-only, uses mock data/local state, simulates email/payment behaviour, and includes all edge cases you described (3-day hold, delegate affairs contact, ability to edit portfolio, waitlists, capacity checks).

Copy-paste this whole block into your builder’s “product spec” or “prompt” field and run it.

# 🔧 BUILDER PROMPT — PROJECTLIBERTY: COMPLETE REGISTRATION FLOW (FRONTEND ONLY)

**System role**
You are a senior frontend product engineer and UX designer. Build the **entire registration workflow** (frontend-only) for ProjectLiberty, the Model UN platform. This flow must be fully interactive with mock data and simulate realistic states (loading, success, error). Do **not** implement a backend — simulate server calls with delays and local state.

**Scope**

* Microsite: “Register now” → multi-step registration UI
* One-time user profile capture (on first registration) — required fields in a single form
* Event-level registration: committee selection, country preference, short committee-specific portfolio (position paper snippet) and optional uploads
* Payment flow: **Pay now** (simulate quick success/failure) OR **Pay later** with 3-day hold (reserve seat, send payment link, reminder emails)
* Post-registration states: Pending, Confirmed, Waitlisted, Rejected, Withdrawn
* Delegate support: Contact Delegate Affairs modal, “Ask for extension”, “Change portfolio” flows
* Organizer UI (mock) to view registrations, approve/decline, send payment reminders, and manage waitlist
* Email / notification previews for key steps (registration confirmation, pay-later link, reminders, assignment, rejection)
* All forms have validation, helpful microcopy, and clear CTAs

**Design constraints**

* Use existing ProjectLiberty design tokens (Liberty Blue #0072CE, gold #FFD700, Inter font).
* Use rectangular buttons (no pills).
* Responsive: Desktop-first, mobile collapse.
* Use local JSON mock-data (events.json, committees.json, users.json, registrations.json). Provide example entries.

---

## UX SPEC — USER JOURNEY (High level)

1. User opens MUN microsite page → clicks **Register**.
2. If not signed in, open **Sign up / Quick profile capture** modal — single form captures required basic details. Save to local state.
3. After profile saved, show **Event Registration** modal / page with multi-step flow:

   * Step 1: Confirm basic profile (readonly, with edit link)
   * Step 2: Committee selection (choose committee, show capacity, remaining seats) + country preferences (ranked)
   * Step 3: Committee portfolio (short text box: 300–500 chars summary + optional position paper upload PDF)
   * Step 4: Payment options (Pay now / Pay later / Invoice request). Show price, taxes, promo code.
   * Step 5: Review & Submit
4. On Submit: if Pay Now → simulate payment modal; on success show Confirmed. If Pay Later → create **3-day hold** (seat reserved) and show **Pending (Pay Later)** with payment link and expiry countdown. Send simulated email/notification preview.
5. Allow **post-registration actions**: Edit portfolio (until deadline/organizer locks), Withdraw, Contact Delegate Affairs (modal prefilled), Pay Now (if previously Pay Later), View status.
6. Organizer dashboard (UI-only): show new registration queue — Approve/Reject, mark Paid, send reminders, promote from waitlist if seat freed.
7. Edge cases: seat taken during signup → show conflict dialog with options (join waitlist, try another committee, contact organizer). If organizer reduces capacity → UI shows conflict list and mock resolution flow.

## DETAILED UI REQUIREMENTS

### A. Microsite / Register CTA

* **Register** button visible top-right on microsite page and above fold on Overview tab.
* Clicking opens sign-in modal if unauthenticated, otherwise goes straight to registration flow.
* Button states: Enabled / Disabled (if registration closed) / Loading.

### B. One-Time Quick Profile Capture (modal)

**Purpose:** collect user’s baseline info **once** on first registration (all fields required).
**Fields (single-page form):**

* Full name (text)
* Email (validated)
* Country (dropdown, searchable)
* City (text)
* Institution/School (autocomplete from mock institutions + “Independent” option)
* Grade/Year (text)
* Phone (optional)
* Short bio (1–2 lines)
* Experience level (radio: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
* Accept code of conduct checkbox (required)

**UX behavior:**

* Validate email format; show helpful errors.
* “Save & Continue” stores to local user state and closes modal.
* If profile already exists, show compact “Confirm your details” preview step instead of the full form.

### C. Registration Multi-step Flow (Event-level)

**Global UI:** Stepper at top (Profile → Committee → Portfolio → Payment → Review)

#### Step 1 — Confirm Profile

* Readonly view of profile fields with “Edit” (opens profile modal).
* Show event-specific notes: registration open/close dates, fees, deadlines.
* CTA: Next

#### Step 2 — Committee Selection & Country Preference

* Show committee list (cards) with: Committee name, short agenda, assigned chairs (small avatars), capacity (seats total / filled), difficulty level (Beginner/Advanced), and "Select" CTA.
* On selecting committee, show **country preference modal**: allow ranking 3 preferences with searchable country dropdowns. Add helper text: “We’ll try to allocate your top choice — rank 1–3.”
* Display live capacity: if seats remaining == 0 → show **Join Waitlist** CTA instead of Select.
* If online event: allow selecting virtual-only or in-person (if hybrid).
* Validate selection: require committee selection to proceed.

**Edge behavior:**

* If committee gets filled in the background (simulate with a mock 2s race), show conflict dialog and offer waitlist or choose another committee.

#### Step 3 — Committee Portfolio (per-event)

* Minimal portfolio required inline: one short text area (300–500 chars) titled **“Committee Pitch / Position Summary”**. Microcopy: “Summarize your approach to this committee in 3–4 sentences.”
* Optional file upload: Position Paper (PDF up to 10MB) and supporting documents. Show drag-drop, progress bar, and preview.
* Allow saving as Draft and Continue Later.
* Show whether organizer requires position paper — if required, mark field mandatory.

#### Step 4 — Payment Options

* Show price breakdown: Registration fee, discounts (promo code), taxes, total.
* Payment options:

  1. **Pay Now** — Simulate card payment modal: allow success and failure states. On success mark **Confirmed (Paid)**.
  2. **Pay Later (3-day hold)** — Reserve seat for 72 hours. Show timer countdown (days/hours/mins). Generate a unique mock payment link and simulate email preview (contains link and expiry). Registration status: **Pending (Payment Due)**.
  3. **Invoice / Bank Transfer** — open a form to request invoice (Name on invoice, Billing address). Mark status **Pending (Invoice)**. Organizer must mark paid in organizer view (UI-only).
* “Pay Later” action: store reservation in local registrations.json with expiry timestamp. Also add a reminder notification scheduled (simulate) at 48 hours and 24 hours pre-expiry.
* “Pay Now” actions show simulated spinner, outcome, and toast notifications.

**Edge cases:** If payment fails, allow retry and show actionable error messages. If Pay Later expires, seat auto-releases (simulate) and user notified.

#### Step 5 — Review & Submit

* Show summary card of all choices (Profile, Committee, Country, Portfolio, Payment option).
* Edit buttons for each section.
* Final confirm button: Submit Registration.
* On submit show animated success screen with status and next steps (download invoice, contact delegate affairs, add to calendar).

### D. Post-Registration Dashboard & Actions (Delegate)

**Status states (UI):**

* **Confirmed (Paid)** — shows Certificate ETA, calendar links, documents, ability to edit non-critical info until lock date.
* **Pending (Payment Due)** — shows countdown to expiry, Pay Now button, link to payment email, ability to request a 2-day extension (contacts Delegate Affairs).
* **Waitlisted** — shows position on waitlist (#X), option to remain on waitlist or withdraw.
* **Rejected** — shows reason and appeal contact.
* **Withdrawn** — shows re-registration link.

**Delegate actions:**

* **Edit Portfolio** (allowed up to organizer-specified deadline)
* **Pay Now** (if pending)
* **Contact Delegate Affairs** — opens a prefilled message modal to organizer/delegate-affairs email with subject and body templates.
* **Invite Teammates** (if event allows team entries) — send mock invites and show acceptance state.
* **Download Registration Receipt/PDF** — simulated download.

**Notifications & Email previews:**

* Registration confirmation email (on Confirmed or Pending).
* Pay-later email with link and expiry.
* Reminder emails at 48h and 8h before expiry.
* Waitlist promotion email (if seat opens).
* All emails rendered as preview modals in the UI.

---

### E. Organizer View (UI-only)

**Registration Queue UI:**

* Table of registrations with columns: Name, Committee, Country Pref, Status (Pending/Confirmed/Waitlist), Payment method, Actions (Approve / Reject / Mark Paid / Send Reminder).
* Organizer can:

  * **Approve** pending registrations (overrides pay-later hold if needed)
  * **Reject** with reason (triggers rejection email preview)
  * **Manually mark Paid** for bank transfer/invoice.
  * **Promote** waitlisted delegates if seat freed.
  * **Send Payment Reminder** (open small composer with mock send).

**Waitlist automation button:** “Auto-promote 1 seat” → organizer approves promotions.

**Conflict resolution UI:** if capacity reduces, show conflict list and quick actions (Reassign / Waitlist / Refund). (All simulated)

---

### F. Edge Cases & Business Rules (must be simulated)

* **Concurrency race:** simulate scenario where two users attempt last seat — implement conflict modal offering options.
* **Pay Later expiry:** when 72h passes (simulate with accelerated clock in prototype), release seat and update status of affected users.
* **Editing portfolio after submission:** allowed until organizer lock date; editing triggers "Updated portfolio" notification to chairs.
* **Duplicate accounts:** if same email tries to register twice, show merge prompt showing both profiles and allow merging (visual only).
* **Promo codes:** simulate 1-2 promo codes (e.g., PLFREE50 → 50% off; STUDENT10 for students). Invalid codes show friendly error.
* **Late registration:** if user attempts to register after registration close time, show “Late Registration” modal: allow organizer override request via contact form.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (what to demo)

* Clicking **Register** on microsite triggers sign-up modal if unauthenticated.
* One-shot profile capture saves and pre-fills future registrations.
* Committee selection UI shows capacity, handles last-seat race, and offers waitlist.
* Portfolio upload accepts PDF, shows progress and preview.
* Payment flow supports **Pay Now** and **Pay Later (3-day hold)**; Pay Later shows countdown, sends mock email, and allows Pay Now later.
* Delegate dashboard shows correct registration status and actionable buttons.
* Organizer UI shows registration queue, can mark paid, send reminders, and promote waitlist.
* Simulated emails/notifications for each critical step (preview modal).
* All flows use mock data and show skeleton loaders / success toasts.

---

## MISC UX NOTES / MICROCOPY

* Position paper helper: “Max 10MB PDF. Prefer 1–2 pages.”
* Payment hold microcopy: “Reserve your seat now — checkout within 72 hours or your seat will be released.”
* Country preference microcopy: “Rank 1–3 — we’ll try to place you in the highest available choice.”
* Waitlist microcopy: “You’re #3 on the waitlist. We’ll notify you if a seat opens.”
* Delegate Affairs contact modal prefill: Subject = “Registration help — [Event]” Body: “Hi, I’d like help with…”

---

## VISUAL & INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS

* Use rectangular CTAs and consistent spacing.
* Use subtle transitions for modal open/close and step changes (150–200ms).
* Use clear color-coded status chips: Green=Confirmed, Amber=Pending, Gray=Waitlisted, Red=Rejected.
* Use accessible labels, aria attributes for upload and countdown timer.

---

## DELIVERABLES (what the builder should produce)

* Fully navigable registration prototype with the above flows (no backend).
* Mock-data files and a `useMockRegistrations` hook simulating async API calls (use `setTimeout` for delays).
* Email/notification preview modals.
* Organizer and delegate UI panels for registration management.
* README with instructions to change mock-data (ttl of pay-later holds) for demoing expiry race.

Paste the above prompt into your AI UI-builder. If the builder asks for a “framework”, choose **React + Tailwind** (or the builder default).
If you want, I’ll next produce the **mock JSON files** (full 15–50 entries) and the explicit **component skeletons** (`RegisterModal.jsx`, `ProfileCaptureForm.jsx`, `CommitteeSelector.jsx`, `PortfolioUploader.jsx`, `PaymentChooser.jsx`, `OrganizerQueue.jsx`) so the builder can drop them into a repo.
